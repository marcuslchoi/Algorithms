stack vs heap:

Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation,
both stored in the computer's RAM .
Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory
and access to this memory is very fast, and it's allocation is
dealt with when the program is compiled.

struct vs class:

struct is value type, class is reference type.
Structs stored on stack, classes on heap
